            I'm a Front-end developer trainee and My goal after finishing my internship, 
            is to acquire as much knowledge and experience as possible. 
            I am a very curious person, therefore I love to research, upgrade, 
            and build upon my skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I love Front-end for many reasons the main being that you can control the view of the website making it comfortable for 
            others, and user friendly. I also love to create a website that is easy to use and easy to navigate.

                I have experience in creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                I can create a website from scratch from just looking at a design, using pure css and html.
                Creating a website feels like magic and I am very happy to do it, in a very attractive and user friendly way.
                I know how to use the latest technologies and frameworks to create a website that is user friendly and easy to use.

              </p>
              <p>
                I have some experience in Back-end development, and I love how it works and how it operats,
                both sides Front-end and Back-end are amazing. 
                I'm so eager to learn more and more about Back-end after finishing Front-end so that I can understand more and more
                how the website works.

            <p>
                I have studied Artificial Intelligence and have experience in creating a chatbot, and game that works on augmented reality,
                both of these projects were exciting and interesting I loved working on them using JavaScript in the game, and 
                creating a chatbot in Python and rasa framework, but what was the most interesting part of the project was the AI part,
                how it works and how it can be used, the way it could segmantate the user's input and give the best response.
             </p>
             <p>
               I also love the idea of studying the data to solve a problem, and I am eager to learn more about the data science field,
               I used to work on hard assignments on problems that were solved before but with data that is unsorted and unorganized,
               it was hard but it was fun thinking of the ways that I can solve this issue and how I can use the data to solve the problem.

                            This is a website that I created as my first web project, it is based on the idea of an online shoe store,
                            where you can view the latest market shoes with their prices and whats on discount.

                           This project was all Front-end and it consists of CSS, HTML and JavaScript, im proud of this small project because it
                           taught me alot about CSS as a beginner.

                            This is an augmented reality game that I wokred on as part of a team, I loved every minute of it, thinking of ideas,
                            levels, obstacles and how to combine them all together was really exciting, but the best part was the 
                            segmentation, it was really fun to work on it and I learned a lot about it.

                           This is Hakim Our medical chat bot that I created as part of a team, it is a chatbot that can help you with your medical problems,
                           at the most amazing thing is that we build it to take arabic input and translate it into english to give you the disease
                           of the symptoms you feel.
